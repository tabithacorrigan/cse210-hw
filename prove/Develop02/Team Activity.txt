DEFINE CLASS BEHAVIORS

    Go through each of your classes and ask:

        What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? (In other words, what things should this class do?)
           
            Program Class
                public static void main()
                Loop through menu options using while, if else, a switch, Do-While

            Journal Class
                - provide code for each menu function
                - list for entries?
                - GetPrompt()

            Entry Class
                - LoadEntry()
                - SaveEntry()
                - Provide a format for the entries, use DateTime()

DEFINE CLASS ATTRIBUTES

    Go through each of your classes and ask:

        What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? (In other words, what variables should this class store?)

        What are the data types of these member variables?

            Program Class
                Attributes:
                    _userInput: string (selecing variable in while loop for the menu)

            Journal Class
                Attributes:
                    _prompt: string (could return a list of prompts, or just one, depending on deisgn)
                    _entry: string
                    _saveToFile: entry
                    _loadEntry: entry
                    _fileName: string

            Entry Class
                Attributes
                    _entry: string
                    _saveToFile: entry
                    _loadEntry: entry
