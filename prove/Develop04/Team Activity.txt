What does the program do?
    Takes the user through activities designed to improve mental health
    Improves mindfullness

What user inputs does it have?
    Menu(activiies)
    Text inputs from reflection activity and listing activity
    Lengths of time
    
What output does it produce?
    Prompts(Listing and reflection)
    Spinners and Timers
    Activity Instructions
    Start and End messages

How does the program end?
    User enters "quit" from the Menu

What are good candidates for classes in this program?
    Activity 
        Refelction Activity
        Listing Activity
        Breathing Activity
    Animations
    Menu?

What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
   Activity: Instructions, welcome, end, and name 
        Refelction Activity : provide refelction prompts, accepts user inputs, but doesn't "save" them
        Listing Activity : Provide Listing prompts, accepts user inputs but doesn't "save" them
        Breathing Activity : provide timed breath prompts
    Animations : Spinners, countdowns and timers

What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? (In other words, what things should this class do?)
    Activity
        GetStart()
        GetEnd()

    Reflection
        GetDescription()
        GetPrompt()

    Listing
        GetDescription()
        GetPrompt()

    Breathing
        GetDescription()
        GetInstructions()

    Animations
        CountdownTimer() -> includes spinner/animation

What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? (In other words, what variables should this class store?)
    Activity
        _activityName: string
        _duration: int
        _startMsg: string
        _endMsg: string
        _description: string
        _instructions: string

    Reflection
        _prompts: List<string>
        _questions: List<string>

    Listing
        _prompts: List<string>

    Breathing
        none

    Animations
        _animationList: List<string>
        _animationDuration: int 

What constructors should each class have?

    In other words, what parameters should you pass in when creating an object of that type.
        Activity
            Activity(name, description, duration, instructions)

        Reflection
            Reflection() : base(name, description, duration, instructions) *in the base(), you could fill in the variables with their values

        Listing
            Listing() : base(name, description, duration, instructions)

        Breathing
            Breathing() : base(name, description, duration, instructions)

        Animations
            Animations(duration)
            

What other work needs to be done to set up these objects?

    For example, does the constructor need to run code to perform set up tasks, like creating lists, iterating through variables, etc.
