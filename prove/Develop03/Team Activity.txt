What does the program do?
    - removes words to help a user memorize scriptures
    - Displays the scripture (including reference)
    - Clear the terminal each time a user enters enter
    - when "quit" is entered, the program will end
    - have the user enter a reference (stretch)

What user inputs does it have?
    - Quit
    - enter (deletes/omits words from a scripture)
    - scripture (stretch)

What output does it produce?
    - scripture (including reference)
    - scripture with words removed (edited scripture)
    - instructions

How does the program end?
    - User enters quit

What are good candidates for classes in this program?
    - scripture
    - removing words (word)
    - reference
    - program 

What are the primary responsibilities of each class?
    - scripture class
        - providing a scripture
        - re-displaying scripture
        - provide format (text, reference) (optional)
        - clear screen
    - Word class
        - remove words
    - reference
        - makes the stretch easier, pulling a scripture from a list/csv file and assign it to a file
        - initially sets the scripture
    - program class
        - call methods from other classes

What are the behaviors this class will have in order to fulfill its responsibilities? (In other words, what things should this class 
do?)
    - scripture class
        Methods:
            DisplayScripture(): string
                - Pull the scripture
                - display the scripture
            Console.Clear()
            * While loop to refresh scripture
                if statement that waits for the user to hit enter, and then will call the remove word method. while should continue unitl the the user hits quit

            Getters and Setters
                - retrieve private member variables
                - set values for private member variables

    - Word class
        Methods:
            Getter and setter
                - get scripture
                - set the edited scripture as the new value
            SplitScripture(): list of the words in the scripture
            ReplaceWord(): random generator that uses .replace() to replace random words with _
            UpdateList(): clear the current scripture list and replace it with the edited version and saves it to a member variable

    - reference class
        Methods:
            - get the reference from the user
            - set the reference to the chosen scripture

What attributes does this class need to fulfill its behaviors? (In other words, what variables should this class store?) What are the data types of these member variables?

    Scripture class
        _scriptureText: string
        _reference: Reference

    Word class
        _scriptureList: List
        _wordIndex (inside of the ReplaceWord()): int

    reference class
        _reference: string

What constructors should each class have?

    In other words, what parameters should you pass in when creating an object of that type. What other work needs to be done to 
    set up these objects? (For example, does the constructor need to run code to perform set up tasks, like creating lists, iterating 
    through variables, etc.)

        Scripture class

           public Scripture(Reference reference, string word) *string is the scripture text

        Word Class

            public Word()

        Reference Class

            public Reference(string book, string chapter, string verseStart, string verseEnd)

            public Reference(sting book, string chapter, string verse)
